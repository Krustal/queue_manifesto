Queue Manifesto
===============

The Queue Manifesto is the doctrine by which I manage my ADD in regards to side projects. This app exists to help me stay diligent.

* The Queue Manifesto manages tasks I need to achieve.
* New tasks are always added to the end of the queue
* Only one item can be removed from the queue at a time
* An active item may be discarded to the back of the queue. This can only be done every 7 days.
* Items on the queue don't have due dates

* The nagging engine: Helps you remember an active task by pestering you across as many channels as possible.
* Active item due dates
* Nested queues: Active items can have a sub-queue that tracks sub-tasks for that item. This nested can go infinitely deep. The visible active item is the leaf task.
